function of the demo:
    get the Chronometer counter from back ground bound service

implement:
    1. use Bound service that can bind to different components
        (the service will run infinitely in the background and can bind to different components)
    2. the Chronometer is run in worker thread
    3. pass the current time stamp from worker thread -> UI thread -> Bound service -> main activity
        (details is in comments of TimerTask class)

concerns:
    communicate between activity and service
        if bind and can return custom IBinder, activity can use the instance of service to access the
        public methods in service class

        use broadcast
            if the receiver is the inner class of activity, only use implicit intent
            because inner class cannot be registered in manifest

    service life cycle
        start, stop, bind, unbind service properly

    way to communicate from worker thread to UI thread
